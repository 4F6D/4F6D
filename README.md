** Computer-Science Student and a big Nerd (duh) **

I'm a full time computer science student and ex technician licensed working of PUDU Robots and Lenovo Hardware. I am interested in every field of computer science or science in general,
but my biggest passion are probably videogames, graphics programming, engine development and engineering in general. I will collect projects here that I care about or have a real world
value for my studies, work or for me and other in general.
